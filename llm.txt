# Preview Deployer – Documentation (docs.prvue.dev)

Preview Deployer creates isolated preview environments for backend applications when GitHub pull requests are opened. Each PR gets its own Docker containers (app + database), path-based routing via nginx, and automatic cleanup when the PR closes or after a configurable TTL.

## Documentation site (Mintlify)

This documentation lives in the docs.prvue.dev repo and is built with Mintlify. It is the canonical user and contributor docs for Preview Deployer.

## Main sections

- **Getting Started**: Introduction (index), Quickstart (prerequisites, tokens, init, setup, first PR).
- **Guides** (tab): Getting Started, Configuration, Architecture, Examples, Operations, Reference. Configuration reference (preview-config.yml, CLI config, env vars, Terraform/Ansible), Architecture (components, data flow, security, deployment tracking).
- **API reference** (tab): OpenAPI-generated pages for the orchestrator API (health, webhook, list/delete previews); spec in `openapi.json`. Same level as Guides tab (see [Mintlify starter](https://github.com/mintlify/starter)).
- **Examples**: Overview of supported vs custom-compose setups; one page per example repo: NestJS, Laravel, Go (supported frameworks with built-in templates), Python, Rust (repo-owned docker-compose.preview.yml).
- **Operations**: Testing (Jest, unit/integration/E2E, guidelines), Troubleshooting (setup, deployment, runtime, security issues).
- **Reference**: How the orchestrator works (webhooks, containers, flow), Orchestrator API (HTTP endpoints for health, webhook, list/delete previews, debugging), Implementation plan (canonical plan for contributors), Agent handoff prompt (Cursor/agent session prompt), Documentation guide (rules and standards for writing docs).

## Main repo and example repos

- **Main repo**: preview-deployer (Terraform, Ansible, orchestrator, CLI). Replace "your-org" with your org when linking.
- **Example repos**: nestjs-project-preview-example, laravel-project-preview-example, go-project-preview-example, python-project-preview-example, rust-project-preview-example. Use placeholder URLs until published; document "Replace with your repo URL" where relevant.

## For AI tools and agents

Use this file as a map: when adding new sections, example repos, or restructuring the docs, update llm.txt so the "map" stays accurate.

- **New session in docs.prvue.dev**: Read **.cursor/agent-guide.md** first. It explains what docs.prvue.dev is, what was done to set it up, repo structure, and how to add or change content. Then use the Documentation guide (reference/documentation-guide) and .cursor/rules.md for structure and writing rules.
- **Full contributing rules**: See the Documentation guide (reference/documentation-guide) in the docs for structure, examples/reference standards, internal links, MDX, and when to update llm.txt.
